1️⃣ BiConsumer (Java 8 Functional Interface)
👉 What is BiConsumer?
BiConsumer<T, U> represents an operation that accepts two input arguments and returns no result.
@FunctionalInterface
public interface BiConsumer<T, U> {
    void accept(T t, U u);
}
👉 When do we use it?
When you want to perform an action using two values
Commonly used in Maps, Streams, logging, updating objects

BiConsumer<String, String> bc1 = (a, b) -> System.out.println(a + b);
BiConsumer<String, String> bc2 = (a, b) -> System.out.println(a.toUpperCase());

bc1.andThen(bc2).accept("hello", "world");
// Chaining using andThen()

3️⃣ HashTable vs ConcurrentHashMap
Feature	Hashtable	ConcurrentHashMap
Thread Safety	Yes (Synchronized)	Yes (Fine-grained locking)
Performance	Slow	Fast
Null Key	❌ Not allowed	❌ Not allowed
Null Value	❌ Not allowed	❌ Not allowed
Locking	Entire map	Bucket-level

---------------------------------------------------------

// Second Highest Salaried Employee using JPQL

SELECT e
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.salary = (
    SELECT MAX(e2.salary)
    FROM Employee e2
    WHERE e2.department = e.department
      AND e2.salary < (
          SELECT MAX(e3.salary)
          FROM Employee e3
          WHERE e3.department = e.department
      )
)

Level	Purpose
1️⃣ Innermost	Find highest salary
2️⃣ Middle	Find second highest salary
3️⃣ Outer	Fetch employees with that salary

---------------------------------------------------------

7️⃣ LiveLock
👉 What is LiveLock?
Threads are active but never progress because they keep responding to each other.
🔹 Example
class Worker {
    private boolean active = true;

    synchronized void work(Worker other) {
        while (active) {
            if (other.active) {
                continue; // keeps yielding
            }
            active = false;
        }
    }
}

🔹 Difference Summary
Problem	Description
Deadlock	Threads blocked forever
Livelock	Threads active but stuck
Starvation	Thread never gets CPU

---------------------------------------------------------

View Resolvers in Spring MVC
👉 What is a ViewResolver?
Maps logical view name → actual view
🔹 Common ViewResolvers
Resolver	Used For
InternalResourceViewResolver	JSP
ThymeleafViewResolver	        Thymeleaf
FreeMarkerViewResolver	        FreeMarker
VelocityViewResolver	        Velocity
ContentNegotiatingViewResolver	JSON / XML

🔹 JSP Example
@Bean
public InternalResourceViewResolver resolver() {
    InternalResourceViewResolver vr = new InternalResourceViewResolver();
    vr.setPrefix("/WEB-INF/views/");
    vr.setSuffix(".jsp");
    return vr;
}
🔹 Controller
@GetMapping("/home")
public String home() {
    return "index"; // resolves to /WEB-INF/views/index.jsp
}
✅ Interview Tip
REST APIs do not need ViewResolvers – they return JSON directly.

---------------------------------------------------------

Basic Parallel Stream Example
List<Integer> numbers =
        IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 10).boxed().toList();

numbers.parallelStream()
       .forEach(n ->
           System.out.println(
               n + " processed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName()
           )
       );
🔍 Output (sample)
5 processed by ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3
2 processed by ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1
8 processed by ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-5

👉 Notice:
Multiple threads
Order is NOT guaranteed
Threads belong to ForkJoinPool.commonPool

How Parallel Streams Work Internally (Important Part)
🧠 High-Level Flow

ForkJoinPool.commonPool

Spliterator splits data

Work-stealing execution
   ↓
