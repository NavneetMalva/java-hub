What is Polymorphism in Java?

Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming. 
Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. 
In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. 
The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, So it means many forms.

Compile-Time Polymorphism in Java

It is also known as static polymorphism. 
This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading. 

Method Overloading

When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded. 
Functions can be overloaded by changes in the number of arguments or/and a change in the type of arguments.


Runtime Polymorphism in Java

It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch. 
It is a process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime. 
This type of polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding. 
Method overriding, on the other hand, occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. 
That base function is said to be overridden.
