 * In Java, the volatile keyword is used to indicate that a variable's value may be modified by

 * variable are immediately visible to all threads. This prevents threads from caching the variable
 * locally, forcing them to read it directly from main memory every time itâ€™s accessed.

/*
Without volatile
If stop were not declared as volatile, the thread might not see the change in stop for some time,
causing it to keep running and ignore the stop request.
This is because, without volatile, each thread can cache variables,
so updates made by one thread may not immediately reflect in other threads' caches.
